# Ethereum-Cryptocoin-Price-Prediction

This project aims to predict the price of the Ethereum cryptocoin based on its price in the past. (co-authored by Antonios Tragoudaras and Konstantinos Milas)

First of all, all files mentioned below, except the report of course, must be placed in the same folder for the notebooks to properly work. In the GitHub repository they are separated in different folders only for the purposes of clarification and order.

This GitHub repository contains all the Jupyter Notebooks and any additional necessary files for this project to work. More specifically it contains:

1) a folder named "Notebook" containing the "crypto_time_series_predict" notebook

2) a folder named "Dataset" containing the one dataset used 

3) a folder named "Report" containing the report of this project

Here is a quick summary of the notebook:

1) crypto_time_series_predict: From our dataset we use only the closing price of the cryptocoin each day and by feeding this information to regression models such as SVM, Auto-ML, ARIMA and many more we try to predict its price for the following days. 

And here is a quick summary of the dataset:

1) ETH-USD_2: This dataset contains the price the Ethereum cryptocoin had each day in many forms, such as the starting and the closing price, the lowest and the highest it achieved etc.

Feel free to experiment with any algorithm, any process or even use totally different datasets from what I used!
